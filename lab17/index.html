        <h2>We've been friends since September 2019</h2>
        <p>We always do our best to help one another. We discuss all our troubles and try to find the best decision in
            any situation. <br>People cannot live without friends. Real friendship is possible only when people respect
            and trust each other, when they have the same interests, when they do something useful together.They say «A
            friend in need is a friend indeed». True friends are always ready to help each other when you are in a
            difficult situation.</p>

                <p>Sofia is a very good, kind and clever girl. We often spend our free time together.She has a rich
                    imagination and her own style. I respect and trust her. We have the same interests. We never envy
                    each other. I do my best to keep my friendship and not to quarrel. We usually debate important
                    events. She doesn't like when people are rude and aggressive.</p>

                <p>
                    At first, I should say that it is not an easy thing to speak about myself&#41;
                    So, I am a girl of 18. I've never thought I'm a beauty, I wish I were more beautiful. I'm more
                    tempered, rather reserved, calm and modest. But sometimes I can lose my temper and become either
                    angry or sad. I like to study because knowledge is useful sometimes. As for me, I appreciate
                    people's honesty, kindness, sense of justice and intelligence. </p>
